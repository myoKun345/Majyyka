Majyyka
============

A magic mod, or you could say, a majyyk mod.

As the title implies, this mod will contain a magic (majyyk) system that is more or less inspired by Homestuck. ([this](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003710), [this](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&p=005968)) However, I will still aim to make it enjoyable for anyone to play.

One of my goals for this mod is to write as much of it as possible in the Scala language. Conveniently, Github provides statistics on the language composition of projects, so you can see how well I am sticking to that goal up above this page.

Roadmap
============

## First Release (0.1.xx, ~December/January)

*Basic Spell Casting* Pretty self explanatory. You use wands with learned spells, and the compatibility of the wand components with each other and the spell determines its relative strength and cost.

*Research System* Again, self explanatory. You use the Book of Majyyks along with some yet-undetermined research mechanic to learn new recipes for spells and items.

## Advanced Mechanics (0.2-9.xx, ~February/March-October/November)

*Advanced Spell Casting and Creation* Spells will be created dynamically as opposed to what will probably be preset spells in the first release. Don't know what else to do with casting though.
